        <PreferenceItemText Text="Through your deity’s blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called positive energy or its counterforce, negative energy. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional heal or harm spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity on pages 437–440; if both are listed, you can choose between heal or harm. Once you choose, you can’t change your choice short of an ethical shift or divine intervention."/>
